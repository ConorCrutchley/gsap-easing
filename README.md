# GSAP Easing

This project aims to clearly define and demonstrate the easing properties of GSAP.

You can find the original easing visualizer [on the GSAP easing page](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/).

This project has only just started, be sure to come back at a later date to see it in its completion.
