# GSAP Easing

This project aims to clearly define and demonstrate the easing properties of GSAP.

You can find the original easing visualizer [on the GSAP easing page](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/).

## Usage

Using the filters, change how the red box will be animated on the grid and press play to see it in action.

Whenever you change the easing type or the speed of the animation, an explanation of what's been selected will be presented along with the overall feeling the animation gives and some typical use cases.

What happens to the red box can be changed in the following ways:

- The box can move on the x axis
- The box can move on the y axis
- It can be rotated
- It can be scaled
- The box can be made more opaque
- The box can be skewed on the x axis
- The box can be skewed on the y axis

Any change made to the filters will update the code generated with the explanation which can then be copied to use in other projects.

## Future

This project is still in its infancy and there are ways it could be improved to give users a better understanding of the types of easing GSAP offers. Here are some ways the project could be advanced in the future:

- Adding real world examples of easing types so users can see how a particular easing is used in the real world.
- Adapting the animated section for mobile devices.
- Setting from filters so the user can change where the animation starts from as well as where it ends.
